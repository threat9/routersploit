The RouterSploit Framework is an open-source exploitation framework dedicated to embedded devices.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/180370.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/180370)

It consists of various modules that aids penetration testing operations:

* exploits - modules that take advantage of identified vulnerabilities
* creds - modules designed to test credentials against network services
* scanners - modules that check if a target is vulnerable to any exploit
* payloads - modules that are responsible for generating payloads for various architectures and injection points
* generic - modules that perform generic attacks

# Build your own
To our surprise people started to fork 
[routersploit](https://github.com/threat9/routersploit) not because they were 
interested in the security of embedded devices but simply because they want to 
leverage our interactive shell logic and build their own tools using similar 
concept. All these years they must have said: _"There must be a better way!"_ 
and they were completely right, the better way is called 
[_Riposte_](https://github.com/fwkz/riposte).

[_Riposte_](https://github.com/fwkz/riposte) allows you to easily wrap your 
application inside a tailored interactive shell. Common chores regarding 
building REPLs was factored out and being taken care of so you can really 
focus on specific domain logic of your application.
